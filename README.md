# budget-tracker

Create a budgeting app that supports *ALL* the following user stories:

- I want to add a new transaction with details such as date, amount, type (income/expense), and category (dropdown with e.g groceries, bills, salary), so that I can keep track of my financial activities.
- I want to view a list of my transactions, showing details like date, amount, type, and category, so that I can quickly review my financial activities.
- I want to edit an existing transaction's details in case I made an error or an update is needed, so that my transaction records are accurate.
- I want to delete a transaction if it was added by mistake or is no longer relevant, so that my financial records are up to date.
